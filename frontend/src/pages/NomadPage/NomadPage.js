This allowed us to efficiently generate HTML templates embedded with JavaScript code, enhancing the rendering capabilities of the application. We used Fetch API to interact with the REST API endpoints, which allowed asynchronous communication between the client and server, enabling dynamic updates without refreshing the entire page.` },

                    During the ideation phase, we carefully outlined our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) along with our stretch goals, providing a clear roadmap for our project. We also crafted detailed user stories to help us empathize with our users, anticipate their needs, and refine our objectives. We then meticulously listed our Mongoose models and their associated properties. By defining the models and properties early in the process, we established a solid framework for efficient data handling and storage.
